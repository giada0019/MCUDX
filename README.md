# MCUDX
A deluxe, refined version of "Minecraft", specifically the legacy console made for the Wii U, with improved combat, 24 new blocks, 12 new items, 3 new mobs, and so much more! This mod aims to be a harder version, but not to unplayability.
things to note
- the mod can slightly work on sdcafiine, but not recommended
- usage is with ftpii u replacing base game files in content, make a backup if you arent sure about this!!
- a hacked wiiu with cfw is required, and aroma is technically not necessary but is just as recommended as a NAND backup in base terms
- you will need pretendo for multiplayer, and is in beta
- mod has only been tested on USA / NTSC digital copies of the game, and Europe / PAL disc versions, if your version isn't this, it may not work
- make world backups as there have been reports of achievements being disabled in survival mode
- loading times will be mainly faster, but terrain generation will not due to the new blocks and evironment changes
- custom skins may be overwriten dependant on their spot
- super mario mash-up has glitched wool, haven't fixed yet
